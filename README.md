Excited to share our completed Mini Voting System project in C! I had the pleasure of collaborating with an amazing team to develop a Mini Voting System using C language. Together, we utilized the power of file handling to create a seamless voting experience.

Key Features of our Mini Voting System: *Implemented file handling to display candidates' information and verify their IDs. *Cross-checked the IDs with the stored data to ensure the authenticity of each vote. *Enabled vote casting, ensuring a fair and secure voting process. *Implemented checks to prevent duplicate votes and ensure data integrity. *Finally, displayed the results of the voting process accurately. About The Team:- We worked in a team of three highly skilled students from fine universities across Bangalore Bhavana Choudhary :- Currently pursuing B.E in Computer Science And Engineering in Acharya Institue Of Technology (Expert In C Programming, Problem Solving and creating user interface design) Priya Birajdar :- Also pursuing B.E in Computer Science And Engineering in Alliance University (Vital role in creating an intuitive voting experience and ensuring data and system accuracy) Atheeq Ahmed :- Pursuing B.E in Computer Science Engineering And Internet Of Things In GITAM University (File Handling and Contributed to the systemâ€™s architecture and data validation) Working alongside my team members, we honed our C programming skills and faced challenges head-on. The concept of file handling proved to be instrumental in organizing and validating voter information effectively.

Our Mini Voting System promotes transparency and accuracy, ensuring a reliable voting process. It has the potential to be utilized in various scenarios, including small-scale elections, club or organization voting, and more. We are incredibly proud of our Mini Voting System project and the collaborative effort that went into it. If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to reach out!
